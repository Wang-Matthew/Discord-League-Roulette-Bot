# Discord-League-Roulette-Bot


This bot does a coin flip and tells you whether or not you should play League of Legends.

Some other Discord bot programmers choose to hide their bot token number in a .env manner but for simplicity I chose not to use a .txt file to hide that code to make this useable for programming beginners. 

The "$League?" message is what prompts the bot to do the coin flip and tell you whether or not to play, but that message can be changed to whatever you want it to be.

Enjoy!
